# Attendance Combobulator
Helps teachers manage attendance by combining data from Zoom and Canvas to generate absence and activity reports for each class period

## License and usage
This program is *only to be used with permission*, which I am happy to give if you contact me.

## Versions
**Version 1** - Correlates activity in Canvas (Instructure) and Zoom to determine if students logged in, which counted as attendence
**Version 2** - Analyzes Zoom chat files (saved locally) and Zoom attendance reports (from the Zoom reports website) and marks students who met a minimum activity threshold in the chat as present.
